Hey there, I'm Cory. I'm a software developer that recently completed the Software Engineering Immersive Cohort with General Assembly. Formerly a large format graphics professional, I decided to make the leap into development to make better use of my time and skills.

Here you'll find my projects from GA as well as personal projects and refactors. I get excited about apps + APIs for the outdoors and conservation, the MERNG stack in general, and tacos.

Outside of coding, I'm an avid fly fisher and gamer. Find me chasing carp around Austin, TX or building villages in Valheim.
