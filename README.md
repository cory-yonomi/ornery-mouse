**Welcome to my Repositories!

Hey there, I'm Cory. I'm a full stack developer currently completing the Software Engineering Immersive Cohort with General Assembly. Formerly a large format graphics professional, I've been slowly shifting into the development world to expand my skills and make a career change.

I'm an avid fly fisher and gamer.
